description: "Project packages and how to use them"
---

This project uses these packages; prefer them over reinventing:

- spatie/laravel-permission: roles/permissions via middleware, policies, gates.
- spatie/laravel-activitylog: audit logs for key models (orders, users, products).
- laravel reverb: realtime broadcasting (prefer over ad-hoc polling).
- pusher/pusher-php-server: broadcasting driver/compat (as configured).
- spatie/browsershot: server-side rendering/PDF/screenshots (queue heavy tasks).
- spatie/laravel-analytics: GA4 queries (cache results; don’t query on every request).
- laravel boost: use MCP/tools where available; prefer repo-aware answers.

Performance notes:
- Analytics calls must be cached and never run on frequent UI interactions.
- Browsershot jobs should be queued, not synchronous in web requests.
