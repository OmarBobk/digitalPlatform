## Livewire 4 (performance-first)
- Default to: `wire:model.defer` or `wire:model.lazy` (NOT live).
- Prefer explicit actions: `wire:click="..."`, `wire:submit.prevent="..."`, `wire:change="..."`.
- Use debouncing only when needed: `wire:model.debounce.500ms`.
- Use `wire:loading` + `wire:target` for UX without extra requests.
- Use `wire:key` for stable DOM.
- Use `wire:ignore` for heavy JS-managed elements (editors, complex widgets).
- Avoid frequent re-renders; keep render() pure.

## Alpine integration
- Alpine controls UI state; Livewire controls server state.
- Sync only at checkpoints (submit, confirm, apply, save).
