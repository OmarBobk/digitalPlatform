## DB/Migrations
- Early stage: editing the latest migration is acceptable if the project workflow uses `migrate:fresh`.
- Otherwise: create a new migration for schema changes.
- Assume MySQL/MariaDB compatibility.
- Add indexes intentionally (search fields, foreign keys, status columns used in filters).
