description: "Tailwind 4.1 + Flux Free + Alpine UI rules"
---

## Flux (FREE only)
- Use only free Flux components/patterns.
- If a Flux Pro component is needed, replace with:
  - plain HTML + Tailwind utilities
  - minimal Alpine behavior

## Tailwind CSS 4.1
- Utility-first; avoid custom CSS unless required.
- Keep class lists readable; extract Blade components if repeated.
- Don’t change colors/layout unless requested.
- Ensure responsiveness + accessibility (focus states, aria, semantics).

## Alpine.js
- Use Alpine for UI-only interactions.
- Keep Alpine small and declarative.
- No complex business logic in Alpine.
