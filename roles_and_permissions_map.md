## Roles and Permissions Map

Roles and permissions are provided by spatie/laravel-permission. Roles and their permissions are defined in the seeder; this map lists where each role or permission is **checked** (middleware, policies, views, actions). The app checks **permissions** (via policies and `@can`), not role names.

### Roles

| Role | Defined in | Permissions | Checked in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` | All permissions | No direct role checks; access via permissions only. |
| `supervisor` | `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` | `view_sales`, `view_orders`, `create_orders` | — |
| `salesperson` | `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` | `view_sales`, `view_orders`, `create_orders`, `edit_orders` | — |
| `customer` | `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` | `customer_profile` | — |

### Backend access

- **Route guard:** Backend routes use `middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'backend'])` in `routes/web.php`. The `backend` middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/EnsureBackendAccess.php`) allows users who have **at least one** of the permissions listed in `config('permission.backend_permissions')`; others are redirected to 404.
- **Page-level checks:** Each Livewire page authorizes via policy (`$this->authorize('viewAny', Model::class)`) or `abort_unless(auth()->user()?->can('permission'), 403)`.
- **UI:** Sidebar items are wrapped in `@can('permission')` so only users with the right permission see each nav link.
