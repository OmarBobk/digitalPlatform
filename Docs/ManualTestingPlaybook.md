# Full Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Testers)

This document is the **complete testing playbook** for the store. Testers do **not** need technical knowledge. Follow steps in order within each section, or use the checklists to track progress.

## How to read this guide

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Success message** | Green toast or positive text after saving. |
| **Error message** | Red text or warning when something is wrong. |
| **Wallet / balance** | Money stored in the customer account for purchases. |
| **Staff area** | Pages after login for **Admin**, **Salesperson**, or **Supervisor** (sidebar on the left). |

## Before you start

- [ ] You have the website address (URL) for testing.
- [ ] You have login details for **Customer**, **Admin**, and at least one of **Salesperson** / **Supervisor** if your team uses them.
- [ ] Use a normal browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
- [ ] For phone tests: use a real device when the guide says so.

**Tip:** For “customer does something → staff sees it,” open **two browser windows** (or one normal window + one private window) with different accounts.

---

## Roles and who sees what

The system has four **roles**. Your menus depend on **permissions** your company assigned. If something is missing, ask your team.

| Role | Storefront | Staff area (sidebar) |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| **Customer** | Yes | No (must not open staff links) |
| **Salesperson** | Optional | Yes — usually **Dashboard**, **Orders**, **Notifications** only |
| **Supervisor** | Optional | Same idea as Salesperson; **editing** orders may be **off** (see Part D) |
| **Admin** | Optional | Full menus: catalog, operations, money, users, **Bug reports** (if allowed), **Website settings** |

**Important:** Only **Admin** should see **Website settings** in the default setup.

**Bug reports (in-app):** The store has a built-in **Report Bug** tool and a **Bug Inbox** for staff. In the default database setup, only the **admin** role gets the **manage bugs** permission. Your company can give that permission to other staff accounts too. **Normal customers** do **not** see **Report Bug** unless they were given that permission.

---

## Part A — Customer

### Scenario Name: Browse the shop and switch language

**Who is acting:** Anyone (logged out or logged in)

**Goal:** See the homepage and switch **English** / **Arabic** if available.

**Steps:**

1. Open the website (homepage).
2. Scroll and confirm you see **categories**, **packages**, and **products** sections.
3. Find the **language** control (header, footer, or menu — your site may use a link or switch).
4. Switch to the other language.
5. If Arabic is used, check that layout direction feels correct (right-to-left).

**Expected Result:**

- No blank or broken page.
- Text changes after switching language.

**Validation:**

- Switch language **twice** — page should stay readable.

---

### Scenario Name: Create an account and confirm email

**Who is acting:** New user

**Goal:** Register and complete email verification if your team requires it.

**Steps:**

1. Open **Register** (from the user menu or login page).
2. Fill **all required fields** (name, email, username, password — follow the rules on the form).
3. Submit.
4. If the site asks you to verify email, open your inbox and **click the link** or enter the code.

**Expected Result:**

- You can log in after registration (and after verification, if required).

**Error cases:**

- Password and “confirm password” do not match → error, account not created.
- Username or email already used → clear error (not a white screen).

---

### Scenario Name: Log in and log out

**Who is acting:** Customer

**Goal:** Sign in with **username** and password and sign out.

**Steps:**

1. Open **Login**.
2. Enter **username** and **password** (this app uses **username**, not email, on login).
3. Sign in.
4. Open the **user menu** (person icon) → **Logout**.

**Expected Result:**

- After login, you see **Wallet**, **My orders**, etc., when logged in.
- After logout, private items (like wallet) are gone from the header.

**Error cases:**

- Wrong password → error, you stay logged out.
- **Blocked** or **inactive** test user → login refused with a message (if your team has such tests).

---

### Scenario Name: Forgot password

**Who is acting:** Customer

**Goal:** Reset password by email.

**Steps:**

1. On **Login**, click **Forgot your password?** (if shown).
2. Enter the account **email** and submit.
3. Open the email → follow the link.
4. Set a **new** password.
5. Log in with the **new** password.

**Expected Result:**

- Old password stops working; new password works.

---

### Scenario Name: Open Wallet and read balance

**Who is acting:** Customer (logged in; email verified if your rules say so)

3. Read the **balance**.
4. Scroll to **transaction history** (if shown).

**Expected Result:**

**Note:** If the store **hides prices** in settings, the header may not show money — still open **Wallet** to test.

---

### Scenario Name: Request a top-up (add money)

**Who is acting:** Customer

**Goal:** Submit a top-up with amount, payment method, and receipt file.

**Steps:**

1. Open **Wallet**.

3. Choose a **payment method** (e.g. Sham Cash, bank transfer — whatever appears).
4. Attach a **receipt file**: **JPG, PNG, WEBP, or PDF**.
5. Submit the form.

**Expected Result:**

- **Success** message.
- Only **one pending** top-up at a time — if you already have a pending request, the site should **warn** you and block a second one.

**At the same time (cross-role):**

- **Admin** should get an **in-app notification** about a new top-up.
- **Admin** **Topups** page should list the new row (immediately or after refresh — see Part F).

---

### Scenario Name: Top-up — validation tests

**Invalid amount:**

- `0` or negative number → error.
- Letters (e.g. `abc`) → error.
- Empty amount → error.

- File type not JPG / PNG / WEBP / PDF → error.
- File **larger than about 5 megabytes** → error (the limit in the system is **5 MB**).

**Error cases:**

5. If **Bug Reports** is **not** in your menu, ask your team whether to try opening the bugs page URL directly — you should get **no access** / **not found** (default: only bug-enabled accounts).

**Expected Result:**

- Allowed pages work.
- Forbidden pages show **not found** or **no access** — **not** real data from other areas.

---

### Scenario Name: Salesperson — edit orders (if allowed)

**Who is acting:** Salesperson

**Steps:**

1. Open **Orders** → open **one order** detail.
2. Perform any **edit** actions your screen shows.

**Expected Result:**

- Matches your company policy (Salesperson can **edit** in default seed).

---

## Part D — Supervisor

**Default (seeded permissions):** View sales, view orders, **create** orders — **no** `edit_orders` in the default database seed.

---

### Scenario Name: Supervisor — orders without edit

**Who is acting:** Supervisor

**Steps:**

1. Log in → **Orders**.
2. Open an order detail.
3. Try **edit** actions.

**Expected Result:**

- If your seed is default, **edit** may be **missing** or **denied** — confirm with your team what is correct **today**.

---

## Part E — Cross-role scenarios

### Customer top-up → Admin sees it

1. Customer submits top-up.
2. Admin: check **Notifications** and **Topups** (see Part F for “without refresh”).

**Expected:** Admin alert + customer row in Topups.

---

### Customer refund → Admin approves → Customer balance

1. Customer: request refund.
2. Admin: **Approve** in **Refund requests**.
3. Customer: **Wallet** and **Notifications**.

**Expected:** Balance increases; notification received.

---

### Admin blocks customer

1. Admin: **Block** user.
2. Customer: login **fails**.
3. Admin: **Unblock**.
4. Customer: login **works**.

---

### Staff submits Report Bug → appears in Bug Inbox

1. Log in as staff with **Bug reports** access (default: **Admin**).
2. Submit a **Report Bug** from the floating button (any page where it shows).
3. Open **Bug Inbox** (sidebar → **Bug Reports**).

**Expected:** The new report appears in the list; open it to see steps and screenshots.

---

### Fulfillment event visibility by role (live updates permissions)

1. Open **Fulfillments** with an account that has fulfillment view access (not necessarily admin).
2. Trigger a fulfillment change from another session.
3. Watch for auto-update for a few seconds.

**Expected:** Live updates work for accounts with fulfillment access, not only admin.

---

## Part F — Live updates (no refresh)

**When:** Your team says live updates are **on** for this environment.

**Test:**

1. Admin: **Fulfillments** or **Topups** open on **Computer A**.
2. Customer: submit **top-up** or trigger an order that creates a fulfillment.
3. Wait **a few seconds** without clicking **Refresh**.

**Expected:** List or badges **may** update automatically. If not, press **Refresh** once — data should still be correct.

**Also:**

- After **login** / **logout**, **Activities** may show new lines (refresh if needed).
- **Bug Inbox:** With **Bug Inbox** open on one screen, submit a new **Report Bug** from another tab (same user). The list **may** refresh on its own; if not, use **Refresh** once.

---

## Part G — Push notifications (phone)

**For:** Staff (usually **Admin**) with the **PWA app** or **installed app** and push enabled.

**Steps:**

1. **Lock** the phone.
2. Customer: submit **top-up** (or trigger fulfillment event).
3. Check lock screen:

   - [ ] Notification appears.
   - [ ] Tap opens **Topups** or **Fulfillments** (depends on event).
   - [ ] Sound plays **if** your team enabled sounds.

**If push never arrives:** check internet; confirm with team whether push is enabled on this server. Still verify **in-app** notifications on PC.

---

## Part H — Account security (settings)

Paths may be: `/settings/profile`, `/settings/password`, `/settings/appearance`, `/settings/two-factor`.

### Two-factor authentication (2FA)

1. Log in → **Settings** → **Two-factor authentication**.
2. Turn on 2FA using the QR / codes shown.
3. Log out → log in → enter **second factor**.

**Expected:** Cannot log in without second factor.

### Change password

1. **Settings** → **Password** → set new password.
2. Log out → log in with **new** password only.

### Appearance

1. **Settings** → **Appearance** → switch theme.

---

## Part I — What each notification means (simple)

These are **in-app** alerts users see. **Customer** and **Admin** get different ones.

| Situation (plain language) | Who usually gets it |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Customer asked for **top-up** | **Admins** |
| **Top-up approved** or **rejected** | **Customer** |
| New **delivery** created for an order | **Admins** |
| **Delivery completed** | **Customer** |
| **Delivery failed** | **Customer** + **Admins** |
| **Delivery** problem during automatic processing | **Admins** |
| Customer asked for **refund** | **Admins** |
| **Refund approved** or **rejected** | **Customer** |
| **Payment failed** at checkout | **Customer** |
| **Loyalty tier** changed | **Customer** |
| Account **blocked** or **unblocked** | **That user** |
| **Wallet** fixed by maintenance (reconcile) | **Admins** |
| **Profit settlement** created | **Admins** |

*(Exact wording on screen comes from your language files.)*

- [ ] Website settings (`/admin/website-settings`) — **Admin only**

### Bug attachments (logged-in users)

- [ ] Open a bug attachment link only when your team gives you a **safe test link** — must be logged in as someone allowed to see that report

### Account settings (Fortify)

- [ ] Settings profile (`/settings/profile`)
- [ ] Password (`/settings/password`)
- [ ] Appearance (`/settings/appearance`)
- [ ] Two-factor (`/settings/two-factor`)

---

## Part K — Final smoke test (before go-live)

Quick **must-pass** list:

- [ ] **Login** (customer + staff) and **logout**
- [ ] **Homepage** and **Cart**
- [ ] **Checkout** (success **or** clear “not enough balance”)
- [ ] **Wallet** + **top-up request** + **Admin** sees it
- [ ] **Orders** (customer list + staff list)
- [ ] **Pricing system**: custom amount min/max/step validation works, and totals are consistent
- [ ] **Pricing precision**: decimal-heavy prices still match between checkout, order details, and wallet
- [ ] **Notifications** (customer + staff)
- [ ] **Admin dashboard** + **Users** list
- [ ] **Fulfillment claim flow**: claim task works, non-admin 5-task cap enforced, admin intervention works
- [ ] **Bug Inbox** opens; **Report Bug** submits a test row (if your Admin has bug access)
- [ ] **Website settings** save (Admin only) — optional if time is short

If **any** fails, **stop** and report before release.

## Reporting a bug (for testers — email / chat / ticket)

When you tell your team about a problem **outside** the app (email, chat, ticket), include:

1. **Where** you were (menu names).
2. **What** you expected.
3. **What** happened (copy **error text** if any).
4. **Role** (Customer / Admin / …).
5. **Browser** and **approximate time**.

**Using the in-app tool:** If you see **Report Bug** (bottom corner) and your account is allowed to use it, prefer filing there during test cycles — it captures **steps**, **screenshots**, and **page context** automatically. You can still send a separate email for urgent production issues if your company asks for that.
